Subject: [PATCH 2/2] UBUNTU: SAUCE: enable pinning of pre AppArmor 3.x policy

Ubuntu several packages that are shipping policy that has not been
updated for AppArmor 3 and abi rules.

Pin the policy to the out of tree networking abi as Ubuntu carried
the out of tree networking patches. Pinning the policy is needed
to address two issues.
1. Silence policy load warnings

   Warning from stdin (stdin line 1): apparmor_parser: File 'example'
   missing feature abi, falling back to default policy feature abi.

2. Ubuntu policy expects to be able to use network, unix, and dbus
   rules but without pinning the abi these rules will either be
   silently dropped or the policy will fail to compile.
